This was a homework assignment from Data Structures and Algorithms, where I was tasked with devising an algorithm
to convert an infix arithmetic expression (e.g. 1+1*2) to postfix form (e.g. 1 1 2 *+), and to evaluate the postfix
expression. This involved a stack, implemented through a singly-linked list.
