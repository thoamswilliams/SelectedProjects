This is a research project I completed under the supervision of Dr. Hiu Yung Wong, at San Jose State University.
I used variational autoencoders (VAE) to identify defects in manufactured circuits, based solely on the input-output
voltage curves of the circuit. Importantly, no domain expertise is required, so this approach remains viabile for
complex circuits, i.e. ones where an analytical model is too physically complex to develop. Work was done in Python,
using the Keras and Tensorflow libraries.
