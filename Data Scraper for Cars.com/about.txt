This was part of an assignment from my Data Science class, where I was tasked with retrieving automobile data from
Cars.com, with the assumption that it would be done manually. Instead, I wrote a Python script to scrape HTML pages
and save the desired information to a .csv file. With my instructor's permission, I shared it with other members
of my class, to great effect. The ~2500 datapoints that could be extracted with the script enabled more accurate
analysis, compared to the ~75 that could be manually collected in a reasonable timeframe.
